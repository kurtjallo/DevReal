### Blockers/Concerns

- Vercel free tier cron limit (2 jobs) is tight for ship check scheduler — may need Pro ($20/mo)
- Supabase Realtime 200-connection limit hit at ~33-66 active crews — Pro ($25/mo) needed before launch
- Drizzle bypasses RLS when using postgres.js directly — need hybrid approach (Drizzle writes, Supabase JS reads)
